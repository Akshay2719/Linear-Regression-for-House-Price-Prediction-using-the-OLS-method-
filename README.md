# Linear-Regression-for-House-Price-Prediction-using-the-OLS-method-
In statistics, ordinary least squares (OLS) is a linear least squares method for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. 
OLS chooses the parameters of a linear function of a set of explanatory variables by the principle of least squares: minimizing the sum of the 
squares of the differences between the observed dependent variable (values of the variable being observed) in the given dataset those predicted 
by the linear function.

Simple linear regression is supervised machine learning algorithm. which is use to find the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable. 
The data-set contain 2 variable one is dependent which is Size and the other is price. So with the help of these data we have to predict the price based on the size.
