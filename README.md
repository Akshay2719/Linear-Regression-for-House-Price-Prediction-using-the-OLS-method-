In statistics, ordinary least squares (OLS) is a linear least squares method for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. 
OLS chooses the parameters of a linear function of a set of explanatory variables by the principle of least squares: minimizing the sum of the 
squares of the differences between the observed dependent variable (values of the variable being observed) in the given dataset those predicted 
by the linear function.
